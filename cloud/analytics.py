"""Server-side product events to OpenPanel.

The browser already reports the funnel (Signup, CheckoutStarted, Subscribed,
QuotaWall*, UpsellModal*). This module reports what the browser cannot be
trusted for:

* **Job outcomes.** Ad-blockers eat a chunk of client-side analytics, and the
  interesting moment — a render finishing minutes later — often happens after
  the tab is gone. Server-side is the only place these are complete.
* **Repeat usage.** The one number that decides whether the product retains:
  on 26-jul-2026, 491 of 564 users who ever processed a video did it exactly
  once. Every clip-quality fix shipped that day (1080p, captions, loudness) was
  aimed at that 87%, and nothing in the stack could measure whether it moved.
  ``job_index`` on each event answers it directly: count distinct users at
  index 1 versus index >= 2, before and after.

Fire-and-forget by design. Analytics must never slow down or break a job, so
every failure is swallowed and every send runs in the background.
